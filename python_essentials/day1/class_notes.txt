Shebang is the name of the first line where you give informations to the interpreter
Ex:
#!Python2.7
To force the program to be executed by 2.7 version 

GOOD PRACTICE: inform the path of the python interpreter you're using
Ex: (which python3)
#!/opt/homebrew/bin/python3

When we use virtual env we can set as follow:
#!/opt/homebrew/bin/env python3
Where the 1st parameter is the env configuration path and the 2nd the command to run

If we see the file shebang.py, and give it. Execution permission by typing chmod +x shebang.py on terminal, we don't need to call the interpreter anymore because the file will be executed by the one specified on the top of it. So only './shebang.py' as any script is now enough to execute it

VIDEO 6

GOOD PRACTICE: program documentation made initial part as well, on """block comment""" including author, aim of the program, also SPECIFIC ENV SETTINGS IMPORTANT FOR COMPILATION, ex if your env var is set LANG=en_US.utf8, the program might compile and show a different output and it may not be wrong it's just miscommunication between the author and the user. So all prerequisites and recommendations	 are supposed to lay here and detailed described.
